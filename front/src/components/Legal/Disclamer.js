Our process </h3><p>
Our machine learning models do the fact-checking we intervene
to train models and correct in case of error. There is no single
process. Models get trained and more accurate with time so no
single method can be stated. We do retrain our models time to
time to remove any bias. We only use non-partisan information
and data sources
</p><h3>
Corrections policy 
</h3>
<p>
We prioritize correcting and training our model timely. Also we
send out a email in case of serious of track of a fact. We produce
no content of our own. Our tool surfs and tags information as
you surf on internet. We are open for suggestions and potential
corrections. You can send us disputes ( link dispute page )
</p>
<h3>Partisan policy </h3>
<p>
We have no human intervention in our models which keeps our
system away from forming any bias but we also keep oscillation
our models to prevent any formation of computer bias.
